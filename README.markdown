Squelch! I've got Cucumber in my Shoes...
=========================================

What?
-----

A tool for parsing features written in [Cucumber](http://github.com/aslakhellesoy/cucumber/wikis) to ensure that the syntax is correct.

Why?
----

So that non-technical members of a team can author the Cucumber feature stories without having to install Ruby, and so that they don't have to do it on the command line.

How?
----

Load a Cucumber feature file to check if the syntax is correct. If you edit the file, click on the cucumber image to recheck the feature.

Download
--------
